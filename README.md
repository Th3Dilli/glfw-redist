# GLFW NuGet #

This repository contains all files and information to create a NuGet package out of the officiel pre-compiled binaries of GLFW.

## GLFW ##

[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) is an Open Source, multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and receiving input and events.
It is easy to integrate into existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.

GLFW is licensed under the [zlib/libpng license](http://www.glfw.org/license.html).
